## What is XMPP?
XMPP (eXtensive Message and Presence Protocol) is a chat service that takes advantage of presence messages (Available, Away, Extended Away, Do Not Disturb, etc) and status messages. XMPP is different from IRC, in the sense the server is hosting the account and processing the messages, as to IRC where the account is hosted on your computer, and you connect to the server for the channels.

## How to create an account?
Creating an account is free and easy.

### Selecting and installing a client
I recommend [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im) for any desktop platform (It supports Windows, macOS and Linux Desktop). Any XMPP client will work with cXMPP.

### Creating an account using a client
To create an account, all you need to do is add an account to your clients config, and tell it to make an account with this information. (on pidgin, there is a tick box at the bottom of the account setup window, check that to make an account).

### Creating an account using E-mail
If you'd rather create an account by sending me an E-Mail, send me an email at cftpservices@gmail.com and provide the following information:

-The username for your account

-The password you'd like to use for the account [(If you would like to encrypt this password with PGP, my public key can be found here.)](https://thewhiteboy503.github.io/cXMPP/pgppub.txt)
